Here we present a program that implements an external merge-sort when the
size of the buffer on which sorting is based is limited to 50 MB.

For using, make sure "output.txt" exists and empty.
For regular sorting, use these parameters:
"A inputFile output.txt columnToSort tempPath"
For example: "A textFile output.txt 2 /tmp"

For selecting (sub-string), use this parameters:
"B (or C)  inputFile output.txt columnToSort tempPath columnToSelect subStringToSelect"
For example: "B textFile output.txt 2 /tmp 1 ab"
